# JavaScript Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains JavaScript code snippets, projects, and solutions designed to improve coding skills and demonstrate various JavaScript concepts. The content is structured to help both beginners and advanced developers understand core JavaScript techniques.

## Key Concepts
The repository covers a wide range of JavaScript topics, including but not limited to:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow and Loops
- Functions and Closures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Asynchronous Programming (Promises, Async/Await)
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Error Handling
- JavaScript ES6+ Features
- Project-based learning

## Code Explanation
Each file is accompanied by clear comments explaining the purpose and logic of the code. In complex examples, pseudo code is provided to ensure better understanding.

### Example Pseudo Code for Array Sorting
```
1. Define a function `sortArray` that takes an array as input.
2. Loop through the array from the first element to the second last element.
3. For each element, find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part.
4. Swap the current element with the smallest element found.
5. Continue until the entire array is sorted.
```


## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Key Notes
- Always ensure your JavaScript files follow best coding practices.
- Comments are included in all code files to enhance readability and understanding.
- Follow semantic naming conventions to make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
