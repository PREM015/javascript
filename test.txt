Got it! Hereâ€™s the rule I'll follow for adding comments to your code:  

### **Comment Rules for Code**
1. **Comment for Every Line:**  
   - I will add comments for each line of code, whether it's a variable declaration, condition, loop, or function.  
   - For functions, I'll include comments for every line inside the function.  

2. **Simple Language:**  
   - Comments will be written in easy-to-understand language.  

3. **Code-Focused Comments Only:**  
   - Comments will explain what the code does, not unrelated details.  

4. **Preserve Existing Content:**  
   - If you ask for a description or explanation about a concept, I'll add that without deleting any existing code or comments.  

This approach will ensure your code is well-documented and clear. ðŸš€
